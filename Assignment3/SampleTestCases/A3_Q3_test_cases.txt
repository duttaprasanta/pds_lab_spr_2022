Test_Case 1 [20]:

INPUT:
Enter the coefficients (a, b, c) of three lines:
Line 1: 1 0 0
Line 2: 0 1 0
Line 3: 1 1 1

OUTPUT:
Point of intersection between L1 and L2 = (0.000000, -0.000000). 
Point of intersection between L2 and L3 = (1.000000, 0.000000).
Point of intersection between L3 and L1 = (-0.000000, 1.000000). 
Side lengths = 1.000000, 1.414214, 1.000000. 
Area = 0.500000

Test_Case 2 [20]:

INPUT:
Enter the coefficients (a, b, c) of three lines:
Line 1: 1 0 0
Line 2: 1 0 1
Line 3: 1 1 1

OUTPUT:
Lines 1 and 2 are parallel so no point of intersection.
