Write a C program that take three coordinates as input. Next, it checks if the triangle is acute-angled,
right-angled, or obtuse-angled.  Your code should do the following: - first compute the lengths of three
sides of the triangle; - check whether the input satisfies the triangle inequality property, i.e., 
max side length is less than the sum of the other two sides; - do necessary checking and print the type 
of the triangle in the terminal.

Sample input:

Enter the three coordinates: (2, 4), (6, 9), (-2, 7)

This is a valid/invalid triangle

This is a XX (acute-angled/right-angled/obtuse-angled) triangle
