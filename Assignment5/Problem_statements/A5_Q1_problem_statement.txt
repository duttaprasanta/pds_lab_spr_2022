Scan three integers as input in main() and store them in three variables, namely a, b, c.
Print their respective addresses and values.
Write a function with appropriate input parameters and call it from main() to rearrange the values of a, b, c, in non-decreasing order.
Print their respective addresses and values, from main().
Notice that the addresses of a, b, c remain unchanged, but their respective values are now sorted in non-decreasing order.
[Hint: Function call by reference]
Example:
    Enter three integers: 5 3 7
    ---Before function call----
    Address of a = 341784
    Address of b = 341788
    Address of c = 341852
    Values in a, b, c = 5, 3, 7
    ---After function call----
    Address of a = 341784
    Address of b = 341788
    Address of c = 341852
    Values in a, b, c = 3, 5, 7
